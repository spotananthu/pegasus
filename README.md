**45_ZENITH_MODULA**

This project is an integrated battery monitoring system designed for electric vehicles, offering real-time data collection and analysis. It aims to enhance battery safety and performance. Target audience includes electric vehicle manufacturers, retailers, and end-users.

The project named **"MODULA"** is integrated using both hardware and software system to build up a Battery Management System(BMS) for electric vehicles.

**Hardware End:**
The project addresses the need for a reliable lithium-ion battery monitoring system for electric vehicles. Current solutions often lack integration, hindering early issue detection and safety. Our hardware comprises advanced sensors, continuously monitoring battery conditions, enhancing safety, and performance.

**Software End:**
Our software complements the hardware, addressing the challenge of cohesive battery monitoring. It analyzes real-time data from the hardware, identifying deviations and converting them into user-friendly alerts and recommendations for prompt user action.

**"Modula" Website:**
We've created the "Modula" website in parallel that bridges the hardware and software components. This platform offers a secure and user-friendly interface for vehicle owners, enabling them to access alerts related to battery issues and essential services. This enhancement contributes to an overall improved user experience.

**HOW IT WORKS?**

HARDWARE

As the basic objective is to predict and detect fault,it is detected using LM35 heat sensor,
Current and Voltage sensor.
● LM35 heat sensor is attached to battery, regulator and motor.
● Voltage and current sensors are attached to line from battery.
● The flow of voltage and current will be monitored by microcontroller and provide
information to user.
● When there’s a change is heat above the tolerance level, it’ll be detected as fault. If the
temperature is rising rapidly, the faulty part will be isolated using relay.
● When there’s a fault in cells of battery, there’ll be change in output voltage and current.
The output data's will be monitored by microcontroller and compare will past data and
predict the level of fault. If the change in output voltage and current is more than the
tolerance value, it is considered as fault and relay will be activated with the help of
microcontroller and the details will be send to user.
● There’s a high chance of short circuit, overloading, overcharging in EVs. To provide
protection to EVs, we include emergency turn off system. If such a fault is detected, the
entire system will be turned off and only be turned on after rectifying the issue manually.

SOFTWARE

Web app to monitor the real time data using MERN Stack.
Realtime Data including Voltage, Current, Resistance and Temperature of Battery from h/w is displayed in Dashboard.
